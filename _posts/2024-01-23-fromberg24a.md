title: 'Beyond Accuracy: Fairness, Scalability, and Uncertainty Considerations in
  Facial Emotion Recognition'
openreview: HRj4VRUPtV
abstract: Facial emotion recognition (FER) from images or videos is an emerging subfield
  of emotion recognition that in recent years has achieved increased traction resulting
  in a wide range of models, datasets, and applications. Benchmarking computer vision
  methods often provide accuracy rates above 90% in controlled settings. However,
  little focus has been given to aspects of fairness, uncertainty, and scalability
  within facial emotion recognition systems. The increasing applicability of FER models
  within assisted psychiatry and similar domains underlines the importance of fair
  and computational resource compliant decision-making. The primary objective of this
  paper is to propose methods for assessment of existing open source FER models to
  establish a thorough understanding of their current fairness, scalability, and robustness.
