title: 'MDD-UNet: Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation with Theoretical
  Guarantees, a Proof of Concept'
openreview: MMR5vRoaNa
software: https://github.com/asbjrnmunk/mdd-unet
abstract: The current state-of-the art techniques for image segmentation are often
  based on U-Net architectures, a U-shaped encoder-decoder networks with skip connections.
  Despite the powerful performance, the architecture often does not perform well when
  used on data which has different characteristics than the data it was trained on.
  Many techniques for improving performance in the presence of domain shift have been
  developed, however typically only have loose connections to the theory of domain
  adaption. In this work, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for
  U-Nets with theoretical guarantees based on the Margin Disparity Discrepancy called
  the MDD-UNet. We evaluate the proposed technique on the task of hippocampus segmentation,
  and find that the MDD-UNet is able to learn features which are domain-invariant
  with no knowledge about the labels in the target domain. The MDD-UNet improves performance
  over the standard U-Net on 11 out of 12 combinations of datasets. This work serves
  as a proof of concept by demonstrating an improvement on the U-Net in it’s standard
  form without modern enhancements, which opens up a new avenue of studying domain
  adaptation for models with very large hypothesis spaces from both methodological
  and practical perspectives.
