title: An Inductive Bias for Emergent Communication in a Continuous Setting
openreview: TdieTXeza3
abstract: We study emergent communication in a multi-agent reinforcement learning
  setting, where the agents solve cooperative tasks and have access to a communication
  channel. The communication channel may consist of either discrete symbols or continuous
  variables. We introduce an inductive bias to aid with the emergence of good communication
  protocols for continuous messages, and we look at the effect this type of inductive
  bias has for continuous and discrete messages in itself or when used in combination
  with reinforcement learning. We demonstrate that this type of inductive bias has
  a beneficial effect on the communication protocols learnt in two toy environments,
  Negotiation and Sequence Guess.
