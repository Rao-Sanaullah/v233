title: Is diverse and inclusive AI trapped in the gap between reality and algorithmizability?
openreview: bnjr0jiMcW
abstract: We investigate the preconditions of an operationalization of ethics on the
  example algorithmization, i.e. the mathematical implementation, of the concepts
  of fairness and diversity in AI. From a non-technical point of view in ethics, this
  implementation entails two major drawbacks, (1) as it narrows down big concepts
  to a single model that is deemed manageable, and (2) as it hides unsolved problems
  of humanity in a system that could be mistaken as the ‘solution’ to these problems.
  We encourage extra caution when dealing with such issues and vote for human oversight.
