title: Effects of Foreground Augmentations in Synthetic Training Data on the Use of
  UAVs for Weed Detection
openreview: BT0K8SjfVm
abstract: This study addresses the issue of black-grass, a herbicide-resistant weed  that
  threatens wheat yields in Western Europe, through the use of high- resolution Unmanned
  Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and synthetic data augmentation  in precision agriculture.
  We mitigate challenges such as the need for large  labeled datasets and environmental
  variability by employing synthetic data  augmentations in training a Mask R-CNN
  model. Using a minimal dataset of 43  black-grass and 12 wheat field images, we
  achieved a 37% increase in Area  Under the Curve (AUC) over the non-augmented baseline,
  with scaling as the  most effective augmentation. The best model attained a recall
  of 53% at a  precision of 64%, offering a promising approach for future precision  agriculture
  applications.
