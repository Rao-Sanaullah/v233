title: Local Gamma Augmentation for Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation on MRI
openreview: zH5xC3wius
abstract: The identification and localisation of pathological tissues in medical images
  continues to command much attention among deep learning practitioners. When trained
  on abundant datasets, deep neural networks can match or exceed human performance.
  However, the scarcity of annotated data complicates the training of these models.
  Data augmentation techniques can compensate for a lack of training samples. However,
  many commonly used augmentation methods can fail to provide meaningful samples during
  model fitting. We present local gamma augmentation, a technique for introducing
  new instances of  intensities in pathological tissues. We leverage local gamma augmentation
  to compensate for a bias in intensities corresponding to ischemic stroke lesions
  in human brain MRIs. On three datasets, we show how local gamma augmentation can
  improve the image-level sensitivity of a deep neural network tasked with ischemic
  lesion segmentation on magnetic resonance images.
