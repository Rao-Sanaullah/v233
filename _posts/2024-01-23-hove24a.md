title: Guiding drones by information gain
openreview: thflkEpXJu
abstract: The accurate estimation of locations and emission rates of gas sources is
  crucial across various domains, including environmental monitoring and greenhouse
  gas emission analysis. This study investigates two drone sampling strategies for
  inferring source term parameters of gas plumes from atmospheric measurements. Both
  strategies are guided by the goal of maximizing information gain attained from observations
  at sequential locations. Our research compares the myopic approach of infotaxis
  to a far-sighted navigation strategy trained through deep reinforcement learning.
  We demonstrate the superior performance of deep reinforcement learning over infotaxis
  in environments with non-isotropic gas plumes.
