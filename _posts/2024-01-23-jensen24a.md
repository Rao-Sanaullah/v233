title: 'Beyond output-mask comparison: A self-supervised inspired object scoring system
  for building change detection'
openreview: xerwVZ4edE
abstract: Updating urban-area maps is crucial for urban planning and development.
  Traditional methods of updating urban-area maps based on aerial photography are
  labor-intensive and struggle to keep pace with rapid urban development. Automated
  algorithms for detecting new and removed buildings based on bi-temporal images typically
  either rely on comparing mono-temporal building detection outputs or requiring examples
  of new and removed buildings for training. This study presents a novel method using
  self-supervised learning principles to train a distinct object-change scoring network.
  It repurposes segments of the (potentially imperfect) delineations used in single-temporal
  detector training, harnesses bi-temporal data attributes, and leverages the assumption
  that most buildings remain unchanged over time. This eliminates the need for explicit
  examples of new or removed buildings, while still overcome usual constraints of
  post-detection output-mask comparison methods. We provide precision-recall curves
  and examples demonstrating the improved performance of the suggested approach. Furthermore,
  we discuss several immediate algorithmic variations that hold the potential for
  even further enhancements in performance.
