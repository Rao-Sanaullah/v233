title: A Dual Convolutional Neural Network Pipeline for Melanoma Diagnostics and Prognostics
openreview: H0DalfbrcD
abstract: Melanoma is a type of cancer that begins in the cells controlling the pigment
  of the skin, and it is often referred to as the most dangerous skin cancer. Diagnosing
  melanoma can be time-consuming, and a recent increase in melanoma incidents indicates
  a growing demand for a more efficient diagnostic process. This paper presents a
  pipeline for melanoma diagnostics, leveraging two convolutional neural networks,
  a diagnosis, and a prognosis model. The diagnostic model is responsible for localizing
  malignant patches across whole slide images and delivering a patient-level diagnosis
  as malignant or benign. Further, the prognosis model utilizes the diagnostic model’s
  output to provide a patient-level prognosis as good or bad. The full pipeline has
  an F1 score of 0.79 when tested on data from the same distribution as it was trained
  on.
