title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Goal-Based Investing Under Regime-Switching
openreview: ngQLmTWOX2
abstract: Goal-based investing focuses on helping investors achieve specific financial
  goals, shifting away from the volatility-based risk paradigm. While numerous methods
  exist for this type of problem, the majority of them struggle to properly capture
  the non-stationary dynamics of real-world financial markets. This paper introduces
  a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for goal-based investing that addresses
  market non-stationarity through prompt reactions to regime switches. It relies on
  the integration of regime probability estimates directly into the state space. The
  experimental results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms
  several benchmarks commonly used in goal-based investing.
