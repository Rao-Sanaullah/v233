title: Clifford Group Equivariant Neural Network Layers for Protein Structure Prediction
openreview: JNfpsiGS5E
abstract: We employ Clifford Group Equivariant Neural Network (CGENN) layers to predict
  protein coordinates in a Protein Structure Prediction (PSP) pipeline. PSP is the
  estimation of the 3D structure of a protein, generally through deep learning architectures.
  Information about the geometry of the protein chain has been proven to be crucial
  for accurate predictions of 3D structures. However, this information is usually
  flattened as machine learning features that are not representative of the geometric
  nature of the problem. Leveraging recent advances in geometric deep learning, we
  redesign a PSP architecture with the addition of CGENN layers. CGENNs can achieve
  better generalization and robustness when dealing with data that show rotational
  or translational invariance such as protein coordinates, which are independent of
  the chosen reference frame. CGENNs inputs, outputs, weights and biases are objects
  in the Geometric Algebra of 3D Euclidean space, i.e. $\mathcal{G}_{3,0,0}$, and
  hence are interpretable from a geometrical perspective. We test 6 approaches to
  PSP and show that CGENN layers increase the prediction accuracy by up to 2.1%, with
  fewer trainable parameters compared to linear layers and give a clear geometric
  interpretation of their outputs.
