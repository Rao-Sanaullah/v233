title: Understanding Neural ODE prediction decision using SHAP
openreview: srok3Fte2E
software: https://github.com/dlkphuong/NODEs-x-SHAP
abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) have emerged as a powerful
  approach for modelling complex dynamic systems using continuous-time transformations.
  Although NODEs offer superior modelling capabilities, little research has been conducted
  on understanding the factors that contribute to their predictions on image datasets.
  In this paper, we propose the leveraging of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP),
  which is an influential explainable artificial intelligence method, to gain insights
  into the NODEs prediction process. We enable the interpretable analysis of important
  pixels that contribute to the prediction decisions of NODEs by adapting SHAP to
  the continuous-time nature thereof. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate
  the efficacy of our proposed approach in revealing the dynamics and important features
  that drive NODEs predictions. Our empirical findings provide insights into how NODEs
  determine important features and the distributions of the Shapley values of each
  class. The proposed integration of SHAP with NODEs contributes to the broader goal
  of enhancing transparency and trustworthiness in the application of continuous-time
  models to complex real-world systems.
