title: Lidar-based Norwegian tree species detection using deep learning
openreview: Y3vDhGwhqU
abstract: 'Background: The mapping of tree species within Norwegian forests is a time-consuming
  process, involving forest associations relying on manual labeling by experts. The
  process can involve aerial imagery, personal familiarity, on-scene references, and
  remote sensing data. The state-of-the-art methods usually use high-resolution aerial
  imagery with semantic segmentation methods. Methods: We present a deep learning
  based tree species classification model utilizing only lidar (Light Detection And
  Ranging) data. The lidar images are segmented into four classes (Norway Spruce,
  Scots Pine, Birch, background) with a U-Net based network. The model is trained
  with focal loss over partial weak labels. A major benefit of the approach is that
  both the lidar imagery and the base map for the labels have free and open access.
  Results: Our tree species classification model achieves a macro-averaged $\mathrm{F}_1$
  score of 0.70 on an independent validation with National Forest Inventory (NFI)
  in-situ sample plots. That is close to, but below the performance of aerial, or
  aerial and lidar combined models.'
