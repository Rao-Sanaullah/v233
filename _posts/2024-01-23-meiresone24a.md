title: Loop closure with a low power millimeter wave radar sensor using an autoencoder
openreview: coJVU6WPFn
abstract: In this paper, we will consider place recognition, more commonly know as
  loop closure, with a low resolution single-chip millimeter wave (mmWave) radar in
  indoor environments. It is an essential part in simultaneous localization and mapping
  (SLAM) systems to avoid drift. By using a novel method to create descriptors or
  latent codes with an autoencoder in combination with exploiting the temporal similarity
  between our latent codes, we are able to successfully extract loop closures with
  a radar-only system without requiring ground truth. Our proposed method is validated
  in an industrial IoT lab on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and on a cargo bike
  in a parking building.
