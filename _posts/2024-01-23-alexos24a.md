title: 'FastStitch: Speech editing by hitch-hiking a pre-trained FastSpeech2 model'
openreview: demSMymWXS
abstract: We present an innovative approach to speech editing, mitigating the time-consuming
  process of training acoustic models from scratch. Our methodology involves fine-tuning
  the upper layers of a pre-trained FastSpeech2 model and fusing it with information
  from a reference mel-spectrogram during inference via a convolution-based, or an
  attention-based, blending network. Comparative evaluations against baseline methods
  and against state-of-the-art techniques on single-speaker (LJSpeech) as well as
  multi-speaker (VCTK) datasets, employing both subjective and objective measures,
  demonstrate the superior quality of our approach, yielding significantly more natural-sounding
  speech edits.
