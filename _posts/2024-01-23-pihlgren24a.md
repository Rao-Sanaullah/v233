title: Deep Perceptual Similarity is Adaptable to Ambiguous Contexts
openreview: yiCC76u3YV

abstract: This work examines the adaptability of Deep Perceptual Similarity (DPS)
  metrics to context beyond those that align with average human perception and contexts
  in which the standard metrics have been shown to perform well. Prior works have
  shown that DPS metrics are good at estimating human perception of similarity, so-called
  perceptual similarity. However, it remains unknown whether such metrics can be adapted
  to other contexts. In this work, DPS metrics are evaluated for their adaptability
  to different contradictory similarity contexts. Such contexts are created by randomly
  ranking six image distortions. Metrics are adapted to consider distortions more
  or less disruptive to similarity depending on their place in the random rankings.
  This is done by training pretrained CNNs to measure similarity according to given
  contexts. The adapted metrics are also evaluated on a perceptual similarity dataset
  to evaluate whether adapting to a ranking affects their prior performance. The findings
  show that DPS metrics can be adapted with high performance. While the adapted metrics
  have difficulties with the same contexts as baselines, performance is improved in
  99% of cases. Finally, it is shown that the adaption is not significantly detrimental
  to prior performance on perceptual similarity. The implementation of this work is
  available online.
