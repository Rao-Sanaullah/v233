title: Scheduling conditional task graphs with deep reinforcement learning
openreview: WZSyFb5xLJ

abstract: Industrial applications often depend on costly computation infrastructures.
  Well optimised schedulers provide cost efficient utilization of these computational
  resources, but they can take significant effort to implement. It can also be beneficial
  to split the application into a hierarchy of tasks represented as a conditional
  task graph. In such case, the tasks in the hierarchy are conditionally executed,
  depending on the output of the earlier tasks. While such conditional task graphs
  can save computational resources, they also add complexity to scheduling. Recently,
  there has been research on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based schedulers, but
  they mostly do not address conditional task graphs. We design a DRL based scheduler
  for conditional task graphs in a heterogeneous execution environment. We measure
  how the probabilities of a conditional task graph affects the scheduler and how
  these adverse effects can be mitigated. We show that our solution learns to beat
  traditional baseline schedulers in a fraction of an hour.
