title: 'TraCE: Trajectory Counterfactual Explanation Scores'
openreview: Jgwi6CaTnU
software: https://github.com/jeffnclark/TraCE
abstract: Counterfactual explanations, and their associated algorithmic recourse,
  are typically leveraged to understand and explain predictions of individual instances
  coming from a black-box classifier. In this paper, we propose to extend the use
  of counterfactuals to evaluate progress in sequential decision making tasks. To
  this end, we introduce a model-agnostic modular framework, TraCE (Trajectory Counterfactual
  Explanation) scores, to distill and condense progress in highly complex scenarios
  into a single value. We demonstrate TraCEâ€™s utility by showcasing its main properties
  in two case studies spanning healthcare and climate change.
