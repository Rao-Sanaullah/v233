title: Neural machine translation for automated feedback on children’s early-stage
  writing
openreview: DCiX0YMd8M
abstract: In this work, we address the problem of assessing and constructing feedback
  for early-stage writing automatically using machine learning. Early-stage writing
  is typically vastly different from conventional writing due to phonetic spelling
  and lack of proper grammar, punctuation, spacing etc. Consequently, early-stage
  writing is highly non-trivial to analyze using common linguistic metrics. We propose
  to use sequence-to-sequence models for translating early-stage writing by students
  into conventional writing, which allows the translated text to be analyzed using
  linguistic metrics. Furthermore, we propose a novel robust likelihood to mitigate
  the effect of label noise in the dataset. We investigate the proposed methods using
  a set of numerical experiments and demonstrate that the conventional text can be
  predicted with high accuracy.
