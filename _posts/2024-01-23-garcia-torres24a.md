title: Comparative Analysis of Binary and Multiclass Activity Recognition in High-Quality
  Newborn Resuscitation Videos
openreview: NzigeDgfx4
abstract: Globally, 3-10% of newborns do not breathe spontaneously at birth and need
  resuscitation. Prompt initiation of resuscitative interventions such as tactile
  stimulation and positive pressure ventilation can reduce neonatal mortality and
  morbidity associated with birth asphyxia. Automated video analysis of resuscitation
  episodes may be beneficial for evaluation and debriefing purposes. In this work,
  a dataset of 220 newborn resuscitation videos collected at the Stavanger University
  Hospital (Norway) is used to develop NBT-I3D, a deep neural network pipeline to
  automatically recognize resuscitation activities. To assess the task, both binary
  and multiclass networks have undergone training, allowing for a comparison of the
  two approaches. Results obtained for binary classification show a mean precision
  and recall of 84.76% and 80.92%, respectively. For multiclass, a mean precision
  and recall of 72.26% and 74.80% are reported.
