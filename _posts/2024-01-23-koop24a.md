title: 'Neural Langevin Dynamics: Towards Interpretable Neural Stochastic Differential
  Equations'
openreview: wFKINgdCtY

abstract: Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NSDE) have been trained as both
  Variational Autoencoders, and as GANs. However, the resulting Stochastic Differential
  Equations can be hard to interpret or analyse due to the generic nature of the drift
  and diffusion fields. By restricting our NSDE to be of the form of Langevin dynamics
  and training it as a VAE, we obtain NSDEs that lend themselves to more elaborate
  analysis and to a wider range of visualisation techniques than a generic NSDE. More
  specifically, we obtain an energy landscape, the minima of which are in one-to-one
  correspondence with latent states underlying the used data. This not only allows
  us to detect states underlying the data dynamics in an unsupervised manner but also
  to infer the distribution of time spent in each state according to the learned SDE.
  In general, restricting an NSDE to Langevin dynamics enables the use of a large
  set of tools from computational molecular dynamics for the analysis of the obtained
  results.
