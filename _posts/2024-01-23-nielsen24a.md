title: Hubness Reduction Improves Sentence-BERT Semantic Spaces
openreview: 6s1gVKXWbZ
abstract: Semantic representations of text, i.e. representations of natural language
  which capture meaning by geometry, are essential for areas such as information retrieval
  and document grouping. High-dimensional trained dense vectors have received much
  attention in recent years as such representations. We investigate the structure
  of semantic spaces that arise from embeddings made with Sentence-BERT and find that
  the representations suffer from a well-known problem in high dimensions called hubness.
  Hubness results in asymmetric neighborhood relations, such that some texts (the
  hubs) are neighbours of many other texts while most texts (so-called anti-hubs),
  are neighbours of few or no other texts. We quantify the semantic quality of the
  embeddings using hubness scores and error rate of a neighbourhood based classifier.
  We find that when hubness is high, we can reduce error rate and hubness using hubness
  reduction methods. We identify a combination of two methods as resulting in the
  best reduction. For example, on one of the tested pretrained models, this combined
  method can reduce hubness by about 75% and error rate by about 9%. Thus, we argue
  that mitigating hubness in the embedding space provides better semantic representations
  of text.
