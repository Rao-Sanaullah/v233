title: 'SafetyCage: A misclassification detector for feed-forward neural networks'
openreview: cWSk6l1xGo
abstract: 'Deep learning classifiers have reached state-of-the-art performance in
  many fields, particularly so image classification. Wrong class assignment by the
  classifiers can often be inconsequential when distinguishing pictures of cats and
  dogs, but in more critical operations like autonomous driving vehicles or process
  control in industry, wrong classifications can lead to disastrous events. While
  reducing the error rate of the classifier is of primary importance, it is impossible
  to completely remove it. Having a system that is able to flag wrong or suspicious
  classifications is therefore a necessary component for safety and robustness in
  operations. In this work, we present a general statistical inference framework for
  detection of misclassifications. We test our approach on two well-known benchmark
  datasets: MNIST and CIFAR-10. We show that, given the underlying classifier is well
  trained, SafetyCage is effective at flagging wrong classifications. We also include
  a detailed discussion of the drawbacks, and what can be done to improve the approach.'
