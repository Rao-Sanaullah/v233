title: Towards AI for approximating hydrodynamic simulations as a 2D segmentation
  task
openreview: TpOsdB4gwR
software: https://github.com/sbrl/research-rainfallradar
abstract: Traditional predictive simulations and remote sensing techniques for forecasting
  floods are based on fixed and spatially restricted physics-based models. These models
  are computationally expensive and can take many hours to run, resulting in predictions
  made based on outdated data. They are also spatially fixed, and unable to scale
  to unknown areas. By modelling the task as an image segmentation problem, an alternative
  approach using artificial intelligence to approximate the parameters of a physics-based
  model in 2D is demonstrated, enabling rapid predictions to be made in real-time.
