title: Heterogeneous Learning for Brain Lesion Segmentation, Detection, and Classification
openreview: ePQt7sOJ8t
abstract: Brain lesions detected in magnetic resonance images often vary in type and
  rarity across different cohorts, posing a challenge for deep learning techniques
  that are typically specialized in recognizing single lesion types from homogenous
  data. This limitation restricts their practicality in diverse clinical settings.
  In this study, we explore different deep-learning approaches to develop robust models
  handling both subject and imaging variability, while recognizing multiple lesion
  types. Our research focuses on segmentation and detection tasks across four distinct
  datasets, encompassing six cohorts of subjects with white matter hyperintensities,
  multiple sclerosis lesions, or stroke abnormalities. Our findings reveal that a
  cascade approach, comprising a fully convolutional network and a fully connected
  classifier, offers optimal accuracy for robust multiclass lesion segmentation and
  detection. Notably, our proposed model remains competitive with models trained solely
  on one dataset and applied to the same dataset while showing robustness against
  domain shifts. Additionally, in related tasks, our model consistently produces results
  comparable with the state-of-the-art methods. This study contributes to advancing
  clinically applicable deep learning techniques for brain lesion recognition, offering
  a promising solution for handling lesion diversity in uncontrolled clinical environments.
