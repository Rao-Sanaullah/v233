title: Typicality-based point OOD detection with contrastive learning
openreview: Pmi6PM8QoZ

abstract: Typicality-based inference methods for OOD detection find a typical value
  (often the mean value) of a model statistic from the training data and then flag
  test points as anomalous if the model statistic of the test data point deviates
  significantly from the typical value. These methods are effective for detecting
  a group of OOD data points when OOD data points are labeled into groups, but ineffective
  for the detection of individual OOD data points. In this paper, we extend typicality-based
  inference to be effective for point OOD detection by utilizing latent features learned
  from contrastive learning and then obtaining the nearest neighbors of a test data
  point to provide additional context used for point OOD detection. The typicality-based
  inference approach is shown to improve point OOD detection relative to several benchmarks.
