title: A Hybrid Spiking-Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Advancing Machine
  Learning Models
openreview: 0YiM1yOSUq
abstract: In this article, we propose a novel standalone hybrid Spiking-Convolutional
  Neural Network (SC-NN) model and test on using image inpainting tasks. Our approach
  uses the unique capabilities of SNNs, such as event-based computation and temporal
  processing, along with the strong representation learning abilities of CNNs, to
  generate high-quality inpainted images. The model is trained on a custom dataset
  specifically designed for image inpainting, where missing regions are created using
  masks. The hybrid model consists of SNNConv2d layers and traditional CNN layers.
  The SNNConv2d layers implement the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model,
  capturing spiking behavior, while the CNN layers capture spatial features. In this
  study, a mean squared error (MSE) loss function demonstrates the training process,
  where a training loss value of 0.015, indicates accurate performance on the training
  set and the model achieved a validation loss value as low as 0.0017 on the testing
  set. Furthermore, extensive experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance,
  showcasing the potential of integrating temporal dynamics and feature extraction
  in a single network for image inpainting.
