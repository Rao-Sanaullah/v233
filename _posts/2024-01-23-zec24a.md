title: Efficient Node Selection in Private Personalized Decentralized Learning

abstract: Personalized decentralized learning is a promising paradigm for distributed
  learning, enabling each node to train a local model on its own data and collaborate
  with other nodes to improve without sharing any data. However, this approach poses
  significant privacy risks, as nodes may inadvertently disclose sensitive information
  about their data or preferences through their collaboration choices. In this paper,
  we propose Private Personalized Decentralized Learning (PPDL), a novel approach
  that combines secure aggregation and correlated adversarial multi-armed bandit optimization
  to protect node privacy while facilitating efficient node selection. By leveraging
  dependencies between different arms, represented by potential collaborators, we
  demonstrate that PPDL can effectively identify suitable collaborators solely based
  on aggregated models. Additionally, we show that PPDL surpasses previous non-private
  methods in model performance on standard benchmarks under label and covariate shift
  scenarios.
