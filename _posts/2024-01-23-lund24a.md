abstract: Deidentification methods, which remove directly identifying information,
  can be useful tools to mitigate the privacy risks associated with sharing healthcare
  data. However, benchmarks to evaluate deidentification methods are themselves often
  derived from real clinical data, making them sensitive themselves and therefore
  harder to share and apply. Given the rapid advances in generative language modelling,
  we would like to leverage large language models to construct freely available deidentification
  benchmarks, and to assist in the deidentification process. We apply the GPT-4 language
  model to, for the first time, construct a synthetic and publicly available dataset
  of synthetic Norwegian discharge summaries with annotated identifying details, consisting
  of 1200 summaries averaging 100 words each. In our sample of documents, we find
  that the generated annotations highly agree with human annotations, with an $F_1$
  score of $0.983$. We then examine whether large language models can be applied directly
  to perform deidentification themselves, proposing methods where an instruction-tuned
  language model is prompted to either annotate or redact identifying details. Comparing
  the methods on our synthetic dataset and the NorSynthClinical-PHI dataset, we find
  that GPT-4 underperforms the baseline method proposed by Bråthen et al. (2021),
  suggesting that named entity recognition problems are still challenging for instruction-tuned
  language models.
